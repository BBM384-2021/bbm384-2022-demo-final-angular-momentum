<h3> LinkedHU_CENG </h3>

For the BBM384 Software Engineering Laboratory course, as the Angular Momentum group, we have developed a full-stack web application called LinkedHU_CENG.
In this application students, graduates and academics in our department can socialize, share job oppurtunities, share course materials and etc. <br>

We used Java Spring Boot and MySQL in the backend of the application. <br>
We used Angular framework, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and jQuery on the frontend of the application.
